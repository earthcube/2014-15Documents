#EarthCube Demonstration Governance Charter

Last Revised July 21, 2014  Link to this version
# 1.	Preamble


The EarthCube Demonstration Governance Charter encompasses the leadership, strategic direction, operations, and all other formalized activities of EarthCube, and defines the structure of the Demonstration Governance phase. It is a living document, which can be amended or adjusted upon vote of the EarthCube membership.

Intent: Each section of the Demonstration Governance Charter, hereafter referred to as the Charter, includes explanatory text on intent, including clarifying objectives and the decision-making process that led to the development of each section.

The Preamble is designed to provide a quick overview of the Charter as well as identify mechanisms for changing it. Maintaining openness and transparency in decision-making (including modifications to the Charter) is one of the core directives for EarthCube. By including references to the Charter as a living document early on, the goal is to ensure that EarthCube participants understand where and how they can participate in the governance process.

## 2. EarthCube Vision, Mission and Goals


Vision: EarthCube enables transformative geoscience by fostering a community committed to providing unprecedented discovery, access, and analysis of geoscience data.

Mission: EarthCube streamlines the path to scientific discovery by overcoming social, institutional, and technical barriers to data sharing and access through a network of interoperable computations resources. These resources will be developed and supported by a community of practice consisting of academic geoscientists and related communities.

Goals: EarthCube will accomplish its mission by:

* Maintaining a knowledge base to guide the development and maintenance of the EarthCube system and to assist users in interacting with that system;

* Making it easy and more productive to share, identify, access, use and evaluate quality data, streamlining the path to scientific discovery;

* Enable data-driven hypothesis testing that would be intractable without EarthCube resources;

* Answering questions that require access to multiple types and sources of data;

* Enabling trust in data and software;

* Developing sustainable and interoperable software and hardware resources;

* Seeking opportunities to build technological and social interfaces to other related efforts, and jointly identifying capability gaps that need to be fulfilled with further research and development; and,

* Supporting projects that implement and test EarthCube resources to address grand challenges in
the geosciences.


Intent: This section should present the broad vision and goals of EarthCube and the governance organization required to support it. The goals should be long-term and provide input into the development of the intended cyberinfrastructure.

## 3 Governance Structures

EarthCube governance will be implemented through the following organizational units, which are fully described in the sections to follow and are visually displayed in Figures 1 and 2.

	3.1	Leadership Council
	3.2	Standing Committees
	3.2.1	Science
	3.2.2	Technology and Architecture
	3.2.3	Council of Data Facilities
	3.3	Engagement Team
	3.4	Liaison Team
	3.5	Funded Teams
	3.6	Working Groups
	3.7	EarthCube Community
	3.8	Special Interest Groups
	3.9	Office

Each governance unit is guided by a distinct charter or set of guidelines determining its internal operations; initial guidelines are included as annexes to this Charter.

Intent: Each governance element may operate differently depending on its needs, as outlined in its individual charter or guidelines. Thus, the Demonstration Governance Charter does not presuppose any structure beyond requiring coordination between Standing Committees, Teams, and the Leadership Council.

### 3.1	Leadership Council

The Leadership Council is the elected voice of the EarthCube community, setting the strategic direction for EarthCube and making decisions critical to the success of EarthCube.

Functions
The Leadership Council will fulfill the following functions:

* Set, implement, and revisit as needed the strategic direction of EarthCube, including identifying what is within and outside of the scope of EarthCube. This includes monitoring of metrics and adjusting course as needed, thereby ensuring the governance organization improves over time;

* Ensure consistency and transparency in policies, procedures, and decision-making, including providing multiple ways for people to participate in the process of making decisions, and communicating outcomes of decisions to the broad EarthCube community;


* Enable communication between governance organizational units to close gaps, eliminate duplication, and build synergies
Establish and manage Standing Committees and Working Groups as needed to perform critical functions;


* Foster business models to sustain and maintain the infrastructure of EarthCube;

* Establish, facilitate, and maintain policies and procedures;

* Provide for public dispute resolution and proactive management of risk and conflicts of interest; and,

* Act as the single point of communication for coordinating with and making recommendations to the NSF and other funding agencies on behalf of EarthCube.



#### Membership

Membership of the Leadership Council is defined by the following nine (9) positions:

Chair: One chair will be voted into office by the EarthCube community and includes a 3-year staggered term: incoming chair, chair, and outgoing chair. A Chair Nominating Subcommittee from within the Leadership Council (and outside participants as deemed necessary) will seek out candidates for the position; self-nomination by EarthCube community members is also acceptable.

Standing Committee Representatives: One representative per committee, selected by the committee per their charter or guidelines

Five At-Large Representatives: Five representatives nominated and elected by the EarthCube community, four of which must be representative of the constituencies of the National Science Foundation Geosciences Directorate (Atmosphere, Earth, Oceans, and Polar), and one of which must be representative of the constituency of the National Science Foundation’s Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Division.

A Nominations and Elections Subcommittee within the Leadership Council will seek out nominations; self-nominations are also acceptable.

Non-Voting Leadership Council Members: Non-voting members include an Engagement Team Representative, a Liaison Team Representative, a representative from the National Science Foundation, and the Director of the Office.

Intent: The Leadership Council’s critical role in defining and refining the scope and vision of EarthCube requires that a structure be initiated during the demonstration phase (September 2014–August 2015). The proposed structure will ensure that the Standing Committees have representation on the Leadership Council, but that the majority of the Leadership Council is responsive to the larger academic geoscience community and, in particular, to each of the NSF directorates participating within EarthCube. Thus, in order to initiate the demonstration phase and ensure timely tests of the structure, the election of the Chair will initially be internal to the Standing Committee Representatives and At-Large Representatives. That is, the Leadership Council will be comprised of eight (8) representatives during the demonstration phase, a chair will be selected from the eight, and a nominations subcommittee will be established during the second half of the Demonstration Governance phase to oversee election of a chair in 2015 by EarthCube members.

### 3.2 Standing Committees

EarthCube has three Standing Committees, each of which is responsible for carrying out several of the critical functions (some functions are also carried out by multiple committees). Additional Standing Committees may be created by the Leadership Council, to carry out functions that are critical to EarthCube and EarthCube Governance.

Each Standing Committee is empowered to create its own charter or guidelines, including defining decision-making and leadership roles, in order to carry out the critical functions assigned to that committee. However, all Standing Committees will have in common a basic structure that includes:

* Open membership to anyone who falls within the parameters of an appropriate member, as identified in the committee’s charter or guidelines;

* Leadership as defined by the committee’s charter or guidelines, inclusive of a representative to the Leadership Council elected from among Standing Committee members. Leadership of the committee should include a two-year term, similar in structure to the Leadership Council, with voting occurring approximately one month following the conclusion of the Annual All-Hands Meeting;


* Coordinating with the Leadership Council to ensure responsiveness to the EarthCube strategic direction;


* Monitoring and coordinating Working Groups;


* Sponsoring ad hoc Working Groups that emerge, described in more detail in the Working Groups Annex;


* Coordinating with the Liaison Team and Engagement Team; and,


* Coordinating with other Standing Committees.



#### 3.2.1 Science Standing Committee

Engage and support end users and stakeholders (e.g. professional societies, publishers, government, commercial), including attracting new users to EarthCube; and,


* Encourage, engage, and enable the next generation of EarthCube stakeholder leadership.


### 3.4 Liaison Team


The Liaison Team will act as a liaison to cyber-initiatives, collaborations, agencies, associations, and other efforts and programs external to the NSF core constituency of academic geoscientists. This may include national and international activities in other scientific and technical domains, as well as the private sector, the education sector, operational geoscience agencies. This Team will provide a steady implementation strategy for proactive outreach to ensure EarthCube is connected to the right external partners, and to ensure that work undertaken by Standing Committees and Working Groups leverages existing initiatives and avoids duplication. This Team is heavily supported by the Office.

Functions

* Establish partnerships, affiliations, and connections to external organizations and initiatives by:


    * Managing and maintaining formal and informal relationships (revisiting formal agreements and Memorandums of Understanding as needed);


    * Facilitating Standing Committee and Working Group engagement and collaboration with external organizations and initiatives; and,


    * Reaching out to potential collaborators.


* Communicate news and developments between external communities and the EarthCube community; and,

* Recommend ways to leverage external capabilities and efforts.



### 3.5 Funded Teams


The funded teams are comprised of representatives from the NSF-funded EarthCube projects, and will act as a coordinating mechanism across those projects. Initially, two teams will be formed, a “Technical Funded Team” and a “Science Funded Team.”

As of May 2013, there are three active award types to be considered: Building Blocks, Conceptual Designs, and Research Coordination Networks. Building Blocks and Conceptual Designs will be part of the Technical Funded Team, and Research Coordination Networks will be part of the Science Funded Team.

The Leadership Council is responsible for identifying whether future awards fit into existing Teams or if a new team (with the option of existing under a different Standing Committee) is needed.

**Functions**

* Seek methods to align the funded projects with the goal of fostering integrated technology to meet end user requirements and create new capabilities to enable transformative geoscience research; and,


* Advise the Leadership Council about what is needed to integrate individual project results into an EarthCube architecture.


### 3.6 Working Groups


Working Groups serve as ad hoc organizational units created in response to a pressing issue, opportunity, activity, or deliverable related to moving forward EarthCube goals.

Working Groups can emerge from the broad EarthCube community, from under the auspices of a Standing Committee, or by direction of the Leadership Council. They can be initiated by any community member, provided they secure a minimum commitment from at least three participants representing at least three separate institutions. Working Groups may bridge more than one Standing Committee, as they can serve as important mechanisms to foster collaboration and resolve issues between Committees.

### 3.7 EarthCube Community


Initially, there will be two classes of membership: Individual Members and Institutional Members. Individual membership/participation in EarthCube is open to all. No registration is needed to participate in, or access the resources of, EarthCube but registration (and acceptance of EarthCube Terms and Conditions) is required in order to vote or take on formal duties as part of the EarthCube Demonstration Governance organizational units (Leadership Council, Standing Committees, Working Groups, Teams, and others).

Institutional membership will initially open, during the first 6 months of the Demonstration Phase, with additional structure to be determined as needed as institutions express interest. Institutions that are members of the Council of Data Facilities are automatically institutional members of EarthCube.

Individual and Institutional members will have the ability to:

1. Contribute to forums, discussion posts, and other publicly accessible areas of the EarthCube website;


1. Form a Special Interest Group (described below);


1. Propose sessions for the Annual Meeting;

1. Participate in any of the EarthCube governance units mentioned above;


1. Have free and open access to EarthCube documents, data and data resources, tools, and software;

1. Form Working Groups; and,

1. Nominate individuals for leadership roles.



In addition to EarthCube members, EarthCube partners are identified by the Liaison Team.

**EarthCube Partners:**

* Include organizations engaged in activities that complement or benefit the EarthCube mission;


* Are approved by the Leadership Council, at the recommendation of the Liaison Team; and,


* May be formal or informal, with terms set by the Leadership Council. The terms may be for a single activity or task, for designated periods of time, or as deemed appropriate by the Council and partnering organization.


### 3.8 Special Interest Groups


Any EarthCube member can create a Special Interest Group focused on any topic relevant to EarthCube. There is no formal review or approval process. Special Interest Groups may request that a page be created on the EarthCube website to explore their topic and engage other participants. No other resources are automatically available to Special Interest Groups, nor will products generated by Special Interest Groups necessarily be EarthCube products.

### 3.9 Office


The Office is the support arm of EarthCube Demonstration Governance, responsible for supporting and implementing functions as assigned by the Leadership Council, in support of Standing Committees, Teams, Working Groups, and general EarthCube community members. The Office may exist entirely in a physical office location, virtually in a distributed team, or through some combination of the two.

**Functions**

* The Office is responsible for the following functions:


* Supporting public relations and community engagement;

* Developing and supporting the EarthCube community website and other online resources;

* Providing support and logistics to Standing Committees, Teams and Working Groups;

* Organizing and running the EarthCube Annual Meeting;

* Tracking metrics and reporting to the Leadership Council;

* Managing and tracking the budget; providing accounting services; and

* Overseeing and supporting the election process.

**Office Review Process**

An external review of the Office will occur midway through each funding cycle or at the request of the Leadership Council.

----------------------------------------

## Existing Guidelines

Intent: These guidelines were developed based on input during the creation, and subsequent reviews of this charter. The guidelines are presented as options, and may be revised by the Leadership Council if appropriate. Additional guidelines will be added as other Committees and Teams are instantiated.

**Leadership Council Guidelines**

*Operations*

Meetings: The Leadership Council will meet at least quarterly.

Decision Making: Decisions must receive a 2/3 majority of the quorum present to pass. Leadership Council members may either vote or abstain. A quorum for decision making is at least 2/3 of the Leadership Council.

Communications: Communications and meetings may occur via telephone, e-mail, or other electronic mechanisms. The Leadership Council will meet, either virtually or in person, on no less than a quarterly basis. In addition to quarterly meetings of the entire Council, Standing Committee Chairs will meet on a monthly basis, either virtually or in person. To ensure transparency, agendas and meeting minutes of the Leadership Council will be made publicly accessible.

Compensation: Compensation for the Leadership Council chair and members is still an open issue, to be decided during the first six months of the Demonstration Governance phase. There are concerns within the community about the precedence and ramifications of providing compensation. Thus, there needs to be appropriate review and deliberation before any decision is made.

Subcommittees: The Leadership Council provides oversight of subcommittees including:

Working Group Approval Committee: Review and approval of Working Groups, including allocation of budget and staffing resources. Composed of Leadership Council members.

Nominations and Elections Committee: Seek out candidates for the position of Chair and the At-Large council members and establishes the election process. Self-nominations from contributing members will also be accepted. Oversight and implementation of the voting process is delegated to the Office. Composed of Leadership Council members and outside participants (as determined by the Leadership Council). Reforms every two years for elections.

*Voting Committee Members:*

Chair and Incoming or Outgoing Chair:

Nominated by the Elections Subcommittee composed of Leadership Council members (and outside participants as determined by the Leadership Council) will seek out candidates for the position and self-nominations will also be accepted.

Voted into office based on an election open to all contributing members
Position includes one year of being an Incoming Chair, one year as Chair, and one year as Outgoing Chair

The nomination process may include a candidates’ forum prior to voting, leveraging existing annual meetings

Standing Committee Representatives: One representative per committee, selected by the committee per its charter

Five At-Large Representatives: Four representatives self-nominated and elected by all members. These four positions must be representative of the constituencies of the National Science Foundation Geosciences Directorate (Atmosphere, Earth, Oceans, and Polar). One representative must be elected representing the constituency of the National Science Foundation’s Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Division.

Non-Voting Leadership Council Members: Non-voting members include an Engagement Team Representative, a Liaison Team Representative, a representative from the National Science Foundation, and the Director of the Office.

### **Working Group Guidelines**

There are resources available from the Office to support Working Groups including staff time, access to collaboration resources (e.g. webinars and conference lines) and funding for non-salary activities such as travel support.

The following requirements are placed on all Working Groups:

Required to have a *Statement of Need and Work* that is publicly available, and should include the following:

* End goal/deliverable;

* List of Working Group Participants;

* Timeline;

* Risk assessment (what might lead to failure, how to mitigate those risks);

* Alignment with EarthCube goals and/or Standing Committee priorities; and,

* Resource and budget needs;

Required to have a minimum commitment to complete the Statement of Need as well as work from at least three participants from at least three separate organizations.

Working Groups will include in their final products, a Statement of Work Completed, noting its relation to the original Statement of Need and Work.

Office is responsible for monitoring progress and will check in with Working Groups halfway or at least every six months through their stated time period. Office will report on progress to the Leadership Council during their standing meetings.


*Working Groups are approved and established in the following manner:*

May emerge from the Leadership Council itself, or Standing Committees (which are then recommended to the Leadership Council during quarterly review meetings for approval).

May emerge directly from the EarthCube community (proposers request approval from the Leadership Council during quarterly review meetings).

Resources allocated to working groups fall under two categories: staff and logistics support, and direct funding.

**Approval and resource allocation process:**

Working Groups that emerge from Standing Committees are reviewed by the Standing Committee with support from the Office to conduct due diligence.

Due diligence includes a review of resources and budget in light of the request, as well as a review of existing working groups to mitigate duplication of efforts.

The Standing Committee then makes recommendations to the Leadership Council.

Working Groups that are not associated with a Standing Committee are reviewed by the Leadership Council with support from the Office.

Budgets can support:

* Domestic travel support;

* Meeting space rental and associated costs;

* Basic materials and supplies; and/or,

* Publications and document dissemination costs;


Budgets may not support:

* Salaries, wages, or fringe benefits for Working Group participants; and/or,

* Indirect costs or facilities and administration costs.
