Vision: EarthCube enables transformative geoscience by fostering a community committed to providing unprecedented discovery, access, and analysis of geoscience data.
Mission: EarthCube streamlines the path to scientific discovery by overcoming social, institutional, and technical barriers to data sharing and access through a network of interoperable computations resources. These resources will be developed and supported by a community of practice consisting of academic geoscientists and related communities.
Goals: EarthCube will accomplish its mission by:
Maintaining a knowledge base to guide the development and maintenance of the EarthCube system and to assist users in interacting with that system;
Making it easy and more productive to share, identify, access, use and evaluate quality data, streamlining the path to scientific discovery;
Enable data-driven hypothesis testing that would be intractable without EarthCube resources;
Answering questions that require access to multiple types and sources of data;
Enabling trust in data and software;
Developing sustainable and interoperable software and hardware resources;
Seeking opportunities to build technological and social interfaces to other related efforts, and jointly identifying capability gaps that need to be fulfilled with further research and development; and,
Supporting projects that implement and test EarthCube resources to address grand challenges in the geosciences.
Intent: This section should present the broad vision and goals of EarthCube and the governance organization required to support it. The goals should be long-term and provide input into the development of the intended cyberinfrastructure.
