## EarthCube's Goal and Vision
December 2014

**EarthCube’s goal** is to enable geoscientists to address the challenges of understanding and predicting a complex and evolving Earth system by fostering a community effort to develop a common cyberinfrastructure to collect, access, analyze, share and visualize all forms of data and resources, using advanced technological and computational capabilities.

**EarthCube’s long-term vision** is a dynamic, community-governed cyberinfrastructure that will support standards for interoperability, infuse advanced technologies to improve and facilitate interdisciplinary research, and help educate scientists in the emerging practices of digital scholarship, data and software stewardship, and open science.
