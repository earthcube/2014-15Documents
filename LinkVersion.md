[Github NOTE: comments and suggestions for revision are here: https://github.com/earthcube/TAC-charter/wiki/Comments-and-Guidance-for-next-version]

**Preamble**

The EarthCube Technology and Architecture Standing Committee is charged with facilitating the development of the technology that is part of EarthCube. This charter defines the scope of committee activity and interests, and the processes through which the committee will pursue its goals. Because committee participation is voluntary, this charter is designed to minimize management overhead and focus on efficient operation.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;Mission and Goals of the Committee&nbsp;

EarthCube's mission is to enable geoscientists to address the challenges for understanding and predicting a complex and evolving Earth system by fostering a community-governed effort to develop a common cyberinfrastructure to collect, access, analyze, share and visualize all forms of data and resources, using advanced technological and computational capabilities.

The mission of the EarthCube Technology and Architecture Standing Committee is to oversee the technology and architecture development of EarthCube to assure that EarthCube infrastructure is community-driven, supports standards for interoperability, and incorporates advanced technologies to become a commonly used capability that supports scientists on their research efforts.

Consistent with this overall mission, the goal of the Committee is to facilitate the continuing development of the technology component of EarthCube by:

- Providing stewardship of the architecture concepts and specification documents. Stewardship includes providing access to documents and change management for those documents. Provide a forum for synthesis of conceptual design and architectural approaches for EarthCube.&nbsp;
- Ensuring coordination between technology development and scientific requirements. Ensure the explicit connection between the scientific process and technical function. Coordinate testbed processes and other mechanisms for development and validation of cyberinfrastructure components for utility in science use cases.&nbsp;
- Facilitating alignment of EarthCube funded projects to foster technology integration.&nbsp;
- Providing recommendations for accommodation and incorporation of different standards in EarthCube.&nbsp;
- Identifying gaps in coverage of needed cyberinfrastructure capabilities, and determining recommendations on how to fill them.&nbsp;
- Developing recommendations for monitoring and assessing performance of EarthCube infrastructure in coordination with other EarthCube groups. Monitoring technical requirements with the goal to ensure EarthCube is meeting end user needs.&nbsp;
- Working with other EarthCube Governance organizations as an emissary between software developers, the science community, and infrastructure, as well as educators.&nbsp;
- Supporting other activities as deemed relevant by the Committee. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

1. Committee Process&nbsp;

The processes outlined here provide a foundation for Committee operations. These processes are flexible and may be adapted as necessary.

## 2.1 Membership

Membership is by registration. Registration requires name, organization affiliation, and working e-mail address (mandatory) to be reconfirmed on an annual basis.

### 2.1.1 Participation

Participation in the committee is based on volunteered effort. Since EarthCube is an NSF initiative, and since a significant amount of research and cyberinfrastructure is supported by NSF through a variety of projects and programs, volunteers may join this committee to participate in activities that are beneficial to the projects that actively support them. In addition, since EarthCube is designed to benefit broadly all areas of geosciences research and cyberinfrastructure, volunteers from the broader community may be interested in pursuing synergistic activities through this committee.

Because of the different circumstances of each member, different degrees of commitment and activity can be expected. The committee will set up mechanisms to accommodate different levels of effort and to encourage commitments to critical activities (e.g., chair positions).

### 2.1.2 Active Membership

Members are expected to participate in one or more of the Committee activities annually to remain active in the Committee. Inactive members will need to re-register for membership annually. Membership registration and meeting attendance will be recorded in a member register to track participation.

## 2.2 Leadership

Two co-Chairs, one who is the Representative to the Leadership council and another who chairs the committee meetings. Both co-chairs have equal and joint responsibility for operation of the Committee.

### 2.2.1 Selection of Leadership

Nominations for co-Chairs may be submitted by any committee member. Current co-Chairs shall assure at least one nomination for each incoming leadership position.

### 2.2.2 Voting 

The Chair shall be elected by plurality of active registered Committee members.

### 2.2.3 Elections 

Elections will be held electronically for a one-week period and will be closed for voting on the first of November for terms starting on January 1 of the following year. If a co-chair is unable of carrying out his/her duties or resigns the position, elections of a co-chair to complete the term of office will be carried out electronically.

### 2.2.4 Terms of Office

Committee co-chairs shall serve for a term of one year starting on January 1. A co-chair may serve for a maximum of 2 consecutive terms. Terms of office in this committee should be compatible with the service terms for the Leadership Council election cycle, when appropriate.

&nbsp;

## 2.3 Operations

### 2.3.1 Meetings

The Committee will meet at least quarterly. Meeting announcement and agenda will be posted on the EarthCube web site and via e-mail at least five business days in advance of the meeting. All meetings shall be open to any interested party. Minutes of the meeting will be recorded by the EC staff or other assigned party and will be available within two working days of the meeting. Minutes shall be available for comment and changes for five days after posting. A list of action items will be maintained by the EarthCube office staff.

### 2.3.2 Decision Making

The preferred means of decision making will be operational consensus. Where such cannot be achieved, a vote may be taken on items posted on the original agenda with a decision taken with a majority of voters present.

### 2.3.3 Compensation

Committee membership is voluntary and not subject to compensation for time. Travel expenses will be reimbursed by request as EC governance funds are available, at the discretion of the EC Leadership Council.

### 2.3.4 Working Groups

Formal working groups require an approved proposal with objectives, statement of work and timeline (see Appendix 1 for link to guidelines and questionnaire, and evaluation criteria). Proposals are approved by the EC Governance Leadership Council. Workgroup timelines may be revised if necessary.

### 2.3.5 Communications

The Committee shall make available communication mechanisms such as EarthCube web-sites, newsletters, meeting minutes and/or other mechanisms that the Committee deems necessary to keep the Committee members and the broader EarthCube community informed of Committee activities and management. Such communications will facilitate transparency of decisions and actions by the Committee.

### 2.3.6 Interface with other Governance Structures 

The Committee may assign volunteer members to provide a working interface with another Committee, Team or other EC Governance structure. Liaisons will report at the Committee meetings of any activities of another group that significantly impact the Committee activities. This will complement the formal channels of communication through the Leadership Council.

### 2.3.7 Revision of this Charter 

This charter is a living document that can be amended or adjusted at any formal meeting of the committee by a majority of the active members of the committee.

# 3. Review Process

- The EC Governance Leadership Council will review Committee operations annually, or at request of the Leadership Council. &nbsp;
- Committee co-chairs will review progress of Committee sponsored working groups semi-annually.&nbsp;
- This charter and any associated documents shall be reviewed at least annually at an early Summer meeting of the Committee.&nbsp;
- Following review and approval of working group proposals by the TAC, the proposal shall be reviewed by the EC Governance Leadership Council within two weeks of submission from the TAC. Reviews shall be done according to guidelines cited in Appendix 1 of this document.&nbsp;
- At one of its scheduled meetings, the Committee will hold an annual review of the status of EarthCube technology and architecture and report recommendations from the review to the EC Governance Leadership Council.&nbsp;

# Appendix 1: Working Group Review General Decision Logic

&nbsp;

- Working group proposal guidelines are at this link.&nbsp;
- The review will either accept a proposal to be sent to the LC for approval and funding, return to the proposers for modification, or reject the proposal.&nbsp;
- If the proposed activity is deemed out of scope of the committee, detracting from other committee priorities, or in conflict with existing committee activities, it can be rejected with explanation.&nbsp;
- Proposals returned for modification are encouraged to adjust their scope of work and operations, as appropriate, to address the review comments and recommendations&nbsp;
- If a proposal does not respond to the current working group proposal guidelines it will be returned without review but with guidance on a revised submission.&nbsp;
